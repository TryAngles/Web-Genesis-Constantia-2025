# ⚡ Cyber Awareness – Think Before You Click

A fast, competition-built cyber-awareness visual created under strict time constraints.  
Designed entirely through **Chrome Inspect Mode** (no VS Code provided), with custom HTML/CSS/JS written manually inside the browser tools.

This project demonstrates quick problem-solving, adaptability under pressure, and the ability to deliver clean results without a comfortable development environment.
